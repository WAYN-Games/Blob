# Creating a system

Implement the abstract class [SystemBase] to create an ECS system.

To create a system, you program the necessary system event callbacks. 
Use the [SystemBase OnUpdate()][OnUpdate()] function to perform the work your system must do every frame. The other callback functions are optional; for example, you can use [OnCreate()] to initialize a system, but not every system requires initialization code.

The system callback functions are invoked in the following order:

![](images/SystemEventOrder.png)

* [OnCreate()] -- called when the system is created.
* [OnStartRunning()] -- before the first [OnUpdate()] and whenever the system resumes running.
* [OnUpdate()] -- every frame as long as the system has work to do (see [ShouldRunSystem()]) and the system is [Enabled].
* [OnStopRunning()] -- whenever the system stops updating, which can be because you set [Enabled] to false or because it finds no entities matching its queries. Also called before [OnDestroy()].
* [OnDestroy()] -- when the system is destroyed.

A system's [OnUpdate()] function is triggered by its parent [system group's] own [OnUpdate()] function. Likewise, when a group changes state, for example if you set the group's [Enabled] property, it changes the state of its child systems. However, children can also change state independently from their parent groups. See [System update order] for more information.
 
All the system events run on the main thread. Ideally, your [OnUpdate()] function schedules jobs to perform most of the work. To schedule a job from a system, you can use one of the following mechanisms:

* [Entities.ForEach] -- the simplest way to iterate over ECS component data.
* [Job.WithCode] -- execute a lambda function as a single, background job.
* [IJobEntityBatch] -- a "lower level" mechanism for iterating over ECS component data chunk-by-chunk.
* [C# Job System] -- create and schedule general purpose C# jobs.

The following example illustrates using [Entities.ForEach] to implement a system that updates one component based on the value of another:
