# General-purpose components

An ECS component (not an instance of the managed `UnityEngine.Component` class) is a struct that contains only the instance data for an [entity](ecs_entities.md). ECS components should not contain methods beyond utility functions to access the data in the struct. You should implement all of your game logic and behavior in systems. To put this in terms of the object-oriented Unity system, this is similar to a Component class, but one that **only contains variables**.

The Unity ECS API provides an interface called [IComponentData](xref:Unity.Entities.IComponentData) that you can implement in your code to declare a general-purpose component type.

## IComponentData

Traditional Unity components (including `MonoBehaviour`) are [object-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) classes that contain data and methods for behavior. `IComponentData` is a pure ECS-style component, which means that it defines no behavior, only data. You should implement `IComponentData` as struct rather than a class, which means that it is copied [by value instead of by reference](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/373419/whats-the-difference-between-passing-by-reference-vs-passing-by-value?answertab=votes#tab-top) by default. You usually need to use the following pattern to modify data:

```c#
var transform = group.transform[index]; // Read

transform.heading = playerInput.move; // Modify
transform.position += deltaTime * playerInput.move * settings.playerMoveSpeed;

group.transform[index] = transform; // Write
```

`IComponentData` structs must not contain references to managed objects. This is because `ComponentData` lives in simple non-garbage-collected tracked [Chunk memory](xref:Unity.Entities.ArchetypeChunk), which has many performance advantages.

### Managed IComponentData

It is helpful to use a managed `IComponentData` (that is, `IComponentData` declared using a `class` rather than `struct`) to help port existing code over to ECS in a piecemeal fashion, interoperate with managed data not suitable in `ISharedComponentData`, or to prototype a data layout. 

These components are used the same way as value type `IComponentData`. However, ECS handles them internally in a much different (and slower) way. If you don't need managed component support, define `UNITY_DISABLE_MANAGED_COMPONENTS` in your application's __Player Settings__ (menu: __Edit &gt; Project Settings &gt; Player &gt; Scripting Define Symbols__) to prevent accidental usage.

Because managed `IComponentData` is a managed type, it has the following performance drawbacks compared to value-type `IComponentData`:
* It cannot be used with the Burst Compiler
* It cannot be used in job structs 
* It cannot use [Chunk memory](xref:Unity.Entities.ArchetypeChunk) 
* It requires garbage collection

You should try to limit the number of managed components, and use blittable types as much as possible. 

Managed `IComponentData` must implement the `IEquatable<T>` interface and override for `Object.GetHashCode()`. Additionally, for serialization purposes, managed components must be default constructible.

You must set the value of the component on the main thread. To do this, use either the  `EntityManager` or `EntityCommandBuffer`. Because a component is a reference type, you can change the value of the component without moving entities across Chunks, unlike [ISharedComponentData](xref:Unity.Entities.ISharedComponentData). This does not create a sync-point. 

However, while managed components are logically stored separate from value-type components, they still contribute to an entity's `EntityArchetype` definition. As such, adding a new managed component to an entity  still causes ECS to create a new archetype (if a matching archetype doesn't exist already) and it moves the entity to a new Chunk.

For an example, see the file: `/Packages/com.unity.entities/Unity.Entities/IComponentData.cs`.
